Isolation and lack of support—no family members, friends, partners or community support to help with the demands of parenting<br>
Stress—financial pressures, job worries, medical problems or caring for a family member with a disability<br>
Unrealistic expectations—a lack of understanding about a child’s developmental stages and behavior<br>
Intellectual disability or mental illness—parents may be unable to adequately care for their child<br>
Lack of parenting skills—parents may not know how to care for their child or may believe it is acceptable to use excessive physical force to discipline or punish a child drug, alcohol or gambling problems—addiction or substance abuse may affect a parent’s ability to meet their child’s needs<br>
Low self-confidence—parents may doubt their ability to meet their child’s needs and find it hard asking for help<br>
Past childhood experiences—parents may have experienced abuse as a child in their own families, which could have caused them to develop an insecure attachment style mental health problem<br>

Try to understand your children. Learn how kids behave and what they can do at different ages. Have realistic expectations and be reasonable if children fall short.<br>
Keep your children healthy. Denying children food, sleep, or healthcare is abuse by neglect.<br>
Get help with alcohol or drug problems. Keep children away from anyone who abuses those substances.<br>
Watch your words. Angry or punishing language can leave emotional scars for a lifetime.<br>
Get control of yourself before disciplining a child. Set clear rules so the child knows what to expect. Avoid physical punishment.<br>
Take a time out. Stop if you begun to act out frustration or other emotions physically. Find someone to talk with or watch your kids while you take a walk. Call a child abuse prevention hotline if you are worried you may hit your child.<br>
Make your home a violence-free zone. Turn off violent TV shows and don’t let kids stay under the same roof with an abusive adult.<br>
Join a support program for new parents.<br>
Take regular breaks from your children. This will give you a release from the stress of parenting full-time.<br>
